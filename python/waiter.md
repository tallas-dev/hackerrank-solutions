The "Waiter" problem on HackerRank involves managing stacks of plates with prime-number-based filtering. You start with a stack of plates, each with a number. Over a given number of iterations, plates divisible by the current prime number are moved to a new stack. Plates that aren’t divisible remain and are processed in subsequent iterations. Once all iterations are complete, the remaining plates are output in reverse order from their stacks.

You can view the full problem and details here: [HackerRank - Waiter](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/waiter/problem).

Here’s a Python solution implementing the logic:

### Python Solution:

```python
def generate_primes(n):
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                break
        else:
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return primes

def waiter(plates, q):
    primes = generate_primes(q)
    answers = []

    for i in range(q):
        A = []  # Plates not divisible by the prime
        B = []  # Plates divisible by the prime

        while plates:
            plate = plates.pop()
            if plate % primes[i] == 0:
                B.append(plate)
            else:
                A.append(plate)

        answers.extend(B[::-1])  # Collect B in reverse order
        plates = A  # Update for the next iteration

    answers.extend(plates[::-1])  # Collect any remaining plates in reverse order
    return answers

# Example usage:
n, q = 5, 2
plates = [3, 3, 4, 4, 9]
result = waiter(plates, q)
print(result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Generating Primes:** We create a function to generate the first `q` primes.
2. **Processing Plates:** For each iteration, we divide plates into two stacks based on divisibility by the current prime.
3. **Collecting Results:** At the end of each iteration, divisible plates are collected, and the process continues with the remaining plates.

This solution ensures the plates are processed as required by the problem.
